# Product Requirements Document (PRD): JejakBelajar

**Version**: 7.1 (Definitive & Highly Detailed)
**Date**: September 25, 2025

## 1. Introduction & Core Concepts

### 1.1. Vision
[cite_start]**JejakBelajar** is a digital platform designed to facilitate the standardized implementation and documentation of **Assessment as Learning (AaL)** within the *Projek Penguatan Profil Pelajar Pancasila* (P5) framework[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The platform aims to create a consistent, structured, and digitally native assessment experience for high school projects, moving the entire process online[cite: 58].

### 1.2. Guiding Principles & Conceptual Framework
[cite_start]The application is architected around the **Assessment as Learning (AaL) Model** [cite: 26][cite_start], which is built on core theoretical foundations including Progressivism, Social Constructivism, Metacognition, and Self-Regulated Learning[cite: 23, 25, 26, 27, 28]. [cite_start]This model is expressed through five key components that guide the platform's design[cite: 43]:
1.  [cite_start]**Goal**: Defining learning objectives at the project's outset[cite: 44].
2.  [cite_start]**Success Criteria**: Establishing transparent assessment criteria for the entire project[cite: 45].
3.  [cite_start]**Task**: Providing structured, sequential assignments through a Project-Based Learning workflow[cite: 46].
4.  [cite_start]**Feedback**: Integrating multi-source feedback from peers (`Peer-assessment`), teachers (`Teacher-assessment`), and self-reflection (`Self-assessment`)[cite: 47].
5.  [cite_start]**Reporting**: Empowering students to report on their own learning, culminating in a **Student-Led Conference**[cite: 48, 50].

[cite_start]The practical implementation of this model is achieved through a standardized **Project-Based Learning (PjBL)** syntax[cite: 41, 49].

## 2. User Roles and Permissions

The platform features three distinct user roles with specific, segregated access rights.

### 2.1. School Admin
Acts as the central **Curriculum and Assessment Manager**, responsible for the structural and academic integrity of all projects.
* **Academic Structure Management**: Performs full CRUD operations on Academic Terms (Year & Semester) and Classes.
* **Account Management**: Performs full CRUD operations on Teacher and Student accounts.
* **User Assignment**: Assigns teachers and students to their respective classes.
* **Project Template Management**: Has exclusive rights to create, edit, and manage **Project Templates**. This critical function includes:
    * [cite_start]Defining the overall **Success Criteria** for a project template[cite: 45].
    * [cite_start]Defining the 6 PjBL stages for a template[cite: 49].
    * Defining **one or more required output instruments** for each stage (e.g., Stage 1 can require both a Reflection Journal and a Self-Assessment).
    * [cite_start]Writing the official, unchangeable **guiding prompt** for all `Reflection Journal` instruments[cite: 62].
    * [cite_start]Writing the official, unchangeable **questions/statements** for all questionnaire-based instruments (`Self-Assessment`, `Peer-Assessment`, `Observation Sheet`)[cite: 62].
    * [cite_start]Defining the detailed **scoring rubric criteria** for each question and journal indicator, specifying the meaning of scores 1, 2, 3, and 4[cite: 67, 71].
* **Monitoring**: Views aggregate, school-level reports and system usage statistics.

### 2.2. Teacher
Acts as a **Project Facilitator**, guiding students through predefined learning flows.
* **Project Instantiation**: Initiates a new project by **selecting from a list of predefined Project Templates**.
* **Project Contextualization**: Fills in project-specific details such as the official Title and Theme.
* **Group Management**: Forms and manages student groups within a project instance.
* **Facilitation & Assessment**: Monitors student progress, provides written feedback, and assesses student work. This includes:
    * Grading `Reflection Journals` based on the student's writing.
    * Filling out `Observation Sheets` for every student in the class.
    * During assessment, the User Interface **must display the relevant, Admin-defined rubric criteria** to the teacher to ensure objective and consistent grading.
* **Reporting**: Views and downloads detailed reports for their assigned classes and students.
* **Limitations**: The Teacher **cannot** alter the stages, outputs, assessment questions, or scoring rubrics defined in the Admin's template.

### 2.3. Student
The learner who actively participates in the project and the assessment process.
* **Task Completion**: Completes **all required outputs** for a given stage in sequence before the next stage is unlocked. This includes:
    * Writing in a **Reflection Journal** using a **Rich Text Editor**.
    * Completing **Self-Assessment Questionnaires**.
    * Completing **Peer-Assessment Questionnaires** for all other **N-1** members of their group.
* **Feedback Loop**: Receives and views feedback from their teacher and anonymized summary scores from their peers.
* [cite_start]**Reporting**: Prepares a portfolio and presents findings during a **Student-Led Conference**[cite: 50].

## 3. Detailed Workflows and Features

### 3.1. Admin Workflow: Project Template Management
This workflow allows the Admin to create the standardized project structures.
1.  **Initiate Template Creation**: Admin navigates to the "Project Templates" section.
2.  **Define Template Metadata**: Admin enters a unique **Template Name**, a **Description**, and defines the overall **Success Criteria** for the template in a Rich Text Editor.
3.  **Configure Stages**: The system presents the 6 PjBL stages. The Admin configures each stage by adding one or more output instruments.
4.  **Define Instrument Content & Rubrics**:
    * If the output is `SELF_ASSESSMENT`, `PEER_ASSESSMENT`, or `OBSERVATION`, the Admin writes the specific **questions/statements**. For each statement, the Admin also writes the descriptive **criteria for each score level (4, 3, 2, 1)**.
    * If the output is `JOURNAL`, the Admin writes a **guiding prompt**. The Admin then defines the **indicators** to be assessed (e.g., "Mengajukan pertanyaan terbuka...") and writes the descriptive **criteria for each score level (4, 3, 2, 1)** for each indicator.
5.  **Save Template**: The Admin saves the completed template, making it available to teachers.

### 3.2. Teacher Workflow: Project Instantiation and Assessment
1.  **Select Project Template**: Teacher selects an active template from a list.
2.  **Fill Project Details**: Teacher enters a unique **Title** and **Theme**.
3.  **Manage Groups**: Teacher creates groups and assigns students.
4.  **Publish Project**, making it visible to students.
5.  **Assess Student Work**:
    * For an `Observation Sheet` stage, the teacher is presented with a class list and can assess each student. The UI will display the relevant rubric criteria for each question to guide the teacher.
    * For a submitted `Reflection Journal`, the teacher views the student's text alongside the full scoring rubric and assigns a score and feedback for each indicator.

### 3.3. Student Workflow: Project Execution
1.  **Access Project**: Student selects the active project and reviews the overall **Success Criteria**.
2.  **Enter Stage**: Student enters the current active stage. Subsequent stages are locked.
3.  **Complete Outputs**: The student sees a checklist of required outputs for the stage.
    * If **Reflection Journal**, a **Rich Text Editor** is displayed with the Admin's guiding prompt.
    * If **Self-Assessment**, a questionnaire is displayed for the student to rate themselves.
    * If **Peer-Assessment**, the system displays a list of the student's **N-1** group members. The student must complete the questionnaire for each peer.
4.  **Proceed**: Once all outputs for a stage are submitted, the next stage is unlocked.

### 3.4. Core Assessment Logic & Reporting
* [cite_start]**Instrument Types**: The platform supports four types of assessment instruments: `Reflection Journal`, `Self-Assessment Questionnaire`, `Peer-Assessment Questionnaire`, `Observation Sheet Questionnaire`[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]**Scoring Scale**: All scorable items across all instruments use a 1-4 point scale[cite: 64]. [cite_start]Questionnaire responses are explicitly mapped[cite: 69]:
    * **Always**: 4 points
    * **Often**: 3 points
    * **Sometimes**: 2 points
    * **Never**: 1 point
* [cite_start]**Dimensions**: Scores are aggregated under the following dimensions: Faith and Piety, Critical Reasoning, Creativity, Collaboration, Independence, and Communication[cite: 73].
* [cite_start]**Quantitative Score Formula**: The achievement score (X) for each dimension is calculated using the formula[cite: 76]:
    $$X = \frac{\text{sum of all item scores}}{\text{total items} \times 4} \times 100$$
* [cite_start]**Qualitative Score Conversion**: The quantitative score (X) is converted into a qualitative category (Excellent, Good, etc.) [cite: 83] using a standardized interval scale. [cite_start]The parameters are calculated as follows[cite: 85, 86]:
    * **Ideal Mean (¬µ)** = ¬Ω (ideal minimum score + ideal maximum score)
    * **Ideal Standard Deviation (ùùà)** = ¬Ω (ideal maximum score - ideal minimum score)

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
* **User Experience**: Intuitive, responsive, and accessible on desktop and mobile.
* **Code Quality**: Modular, reusable components, clean, and maintainable.
* **Security & Reliability**: Role-based access control and automated backups.

---

## 5. Technical Specifications
* **Frontend Framework**: Next.js
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
* **UI Component Library**: shadcn/ui (using the **shadcn-blocks** dashboard template).
* **Database**: Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL)
* **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (Auth.js).
